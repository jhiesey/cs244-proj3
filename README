Instructions to run the assignment:
sudo ./initcwnd-sweep.sh

A sample graph is included in this milestone tarball in result.png

By way of a status update:

This code was copied from proj2, so some of the filenames are off.
However, we have constructed the basic topology, can measure the time
it takes to download a file (using curl), and also can do an end to
end run (using initcwnd-sweep.sh) to generate a plot. The plotting
code is finished.

The main issue right now is reliably changing the cwnd and having that
show up in our results. We know theoretically how to do this, but we
aren't convinced the commands we run are having an effect.
